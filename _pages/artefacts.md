This year, SEFM includes an artefact evaluation performed by the artefact evaluation committee (AEC). The artefact evaluation serves to enable future researchers to effectively build on and compare with previous work. We will be attributing 3 badges, according to [EAPLS badging scheme](https://eapls.org/pages/artifact_badges/):

1. Artefact functional: documented, consistent, complete, exercisable;
2. Artefact reusable: exceeding functional, by being carefully documented and well-structured for reuse and repurposing, see below for details;
3. Artefact available: available on a publicly accessible archival repository to a permanent repository that provides a Digital Object Identifier (DOI).

**Tool papers** must be accompanied by an artefact. This artefact should at least meet the requirements for the functional badge for the paper to be eligible for acceptance.  
Authors of **regular papers** are not required to have an accompanied artefact but are however welcome to submit one for evaluation.

## Important Dates

- Artefact submission for tool papers: 9th of June 2023
- Artefact submission for regular papers: 16th of June 2023
- Author notification: 18th of August 2023

All deadlines are AoE.

## Packaging and Submission instructions

More details on packaging and submission of artifacts will be published soon on this page.
