## Travelling to Eindhoven

### Travel by plane
Eindhoven can be reached by either flying to [Amsterdam Schiphol airport](https://www.schiphol.nl/en/) (AMS) or [Eindhoven airport](https://www.eindhovenairport.nl/nl) (EIN).
Direct flights to Schiphol are available from most major locations around the world.
From Schiphol, the best way to continue your trip to Eindhoven is by train (see below).

Eindhoven receives mostly flights from within Europe.
From the airport, the city center of Eindhoven can be reached by a [regular bus service](https://www.hermes.nl/en) (line 400 or line 401).
Single fare tickets can be purchased at a vending machine (located near the bus stop in front of the airport) or [online](https://www.hermes.nl/en/shop/e-tickets/eindhoven-airport-express-single-trip).
It is **not** possible to pay by cash in the bus, although some debit cards are accepted.

### Travel by train
If your flight arrives at Amsterdam Schiphol airport, the most convenient way to reach Eindhoven is by train.
The airport has a railway station that is located under Schiphol Plaza.
[Dutch railways](https://www.ns.nl/en) runs regular service to Eindhoven; a trip planner is available [here](https://www.ns.nl/en/journeyplanner/#/?vertrek=Schiphol%20Airport&vertrektype=treinstation&aankomst=Eindhoven%20Centraal&aankomsttype=treinstation).
The trip takes about 1.5 hours; a ticket costs about &euro;24.
Tickets are available at the vending machines in Schiphol Plaza.

International trains arriving at Rotterdam (Eurostar from London, Thalys from Paris/Brussels) or Venlo (regional train from Hamm and D&uuml;sseldorf) also have excellent connections to Eindhoven.

### Travel by car
Eindhoven is located next to the A2 and A67 highways, and is thus easy to reach by car.
Parking is paid in most of the city center and also on the university campus.

This industrial tradition has grown into a large hub of high-tech and innovative companies, collectively known as the *Brainport region*.
