## Travelling to Eindhoven

### Travel by plane
Eindhoven can be reached by either flying to [Amsterdam Schiphol airport](https://www.schiphol.nl/en/) (AMS) or [Eindhoven airport](https://www.eindhovenairport.nl/nl) (EIN).
Direct flights to Schiphol are available from most major locations around the world.
From Schiphol, the best way to continue your trip to Eindhoven is by train (see below).

Eindhoven receives mostly flights from within Europe.
From the airport, the city center of Eindhoven can be reached by a [regular bus service](https://www.hermes.nl/en) (line 400 or line 401).
Single fare tickets can be purchased at a vending machine (located near the bus stop in front of the airport) or [online](https://www.hermes.nl/en/shop/e-tickets/eindhoven-airport-express-single-trip).
It is **not** possible to pay by cash in the bus, although some debit cards are accepted.

### Travel by train
If your flight arrives at Amsterdam Schiphol airport, the most convenient way to reach Eindhoven is by train.
The airport has a railway station that is located under Schiphol Plaza.

Eindhoven is a city in the province of Noord-Brabant in the south of the Netherlands.
It is the fifth-largest city in the Netherlands and it is well known as the headquarters of Philips and DAF Trucks.
This industrial tradition has grown into a large hub of high-tech and innovative companies, collectively known as the *Brainport region*.

The annual light art festival [*Glow*](https://gloweindhoven.nl/) takes place right after SEFM, from 11-18 November.

After the visit to the Philips Museum, from 18:00-21:30, there will be a banquet at restaurant [Stories](https://stories-eindhoven.nl/) (Torenallee 22-02, 5617 BD Eindhoven, ).

Stories is located on Strijp-S, and the roughly 20 minutes' walk from the Philips Museum will allow you to see part of the Strijp area, including the Philips Stadium, where PSV Eindhoven plays their football matches.
Strijp-S is one of the (former) industrial areas that housed Philips factories until the 90s.
From 2000 onwards, the area has been redeveloped to facilitate the creative industry and housing.
