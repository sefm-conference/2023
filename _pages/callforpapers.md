<h2>Overview and Scope</h2>
<p>The 21st edition of the International Conference on Software Engineering and
Formal Methods will be held between <b>6 and 10 November 2023</b>. The conference
aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from academia, industry and
government, to advance the state of the art in formal methods, to facilitate their
 uptake in the software industry, and to encourage their integration within practical
  software engineering methods and tools.
</p>

<p>The topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following aspects of
software engineering and formal methods.</p>

<h4 class="areas">Software Development Methods</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Formal modeling, specification, and design</b></li>
  <li><b>Software evolution, maintenance, re-engineering, and reuse</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><b>Programming languages</b></li>
  <li><b>Domain-specific languages</b></li>
  <li><b>Type theory</b></li>
  <li><b>Abstraction and refinement</b></li>
</ul>

<h4 class="areas">Software Testing, Validation, and Verification</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Model checking, theorem proving, and decision procedures</b></li>
  <li><b>Testing and runtime verification</b></li>
  <li><b>Statistical and probabilistic analysis</b></li>
  <li><b>Software synthesis</b></li>
  <li><b>Lightweight and scalable formal methods</b></li>
  <li><b>Analysis of dependability, performance and other non-functional properties</b></li>
  <li><b>Resilience, security, privacy, and trust</b></li>

</ul>

<h4 class="areas">Case studies, best practices, and experience reports</h4>

<h2 class="importantH">Paper submission</h2>

<p>Details about paper submission will be announced soon.</p>

<!-- <p>We solicit two categories of papers:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p><b>Regular papers</b> describing original research results, case studies, or surveys.
   Regular papers should not exceed <b>15 pages</b>, excluding bibliography. <br>Two more pages containing only
   references are permitted.</p></li>
   <li><p><b>Tool papers</b> that describe an operational tool and its contributions. Tool papers should not exceed
   <b>6 pages</b> (including bibliography) and should include the URL of the tool.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>All submissions must be original, unpublished, and not submitted concurrently for publication elsewhere. </p>
